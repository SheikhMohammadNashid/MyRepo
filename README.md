# README — Snapshot of My Skills & Code

This repository is a living snapshot of the skills, experiments, and projects I’ve built over time. It collects code, notes, and small demos that show how I learn, solve problems, and grow as a developer/engineer.

## What this repo is

* A curated archive of practical code samples, mini-projects, and learning experiments.
* A timeline-style record of the tools, languages, and techniques I’ve practiced.
* A place to show how ideas progressed from concept → prototype → polished example.

## Why it exists

I learn best by building. This repo makes progress visible: every commit captures a lesson learned, a bug fixed, or a technique mastered. It’s useful for me (reference & reflection) and for anyone who wants to see my approach to practical problems.

## What you’ll find here

* Small projects and prototypes demonstrating specific concepts.
* Scripts, utilities, and configuration files I use regularly.
* Short notes and README files explaining each project’s purpose and status.
* Tests, examples, and basic documentation to help you run the code quickly.

## How to use

1. Browse the folders to find an area of interest (e.g., `python/`, `embedded/`, `web/`).
2. Read each project’s README for setup and usage.
3. Run examples locally, tinker with the code, or use ideas in your projects.

## Contributing / Feedback

This repo is mostly a personal learning log, but suggestions and improvements are welcome. Open an issue or submit a PR if you see a clearer approach or a bug.
