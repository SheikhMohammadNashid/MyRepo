'''In Python, a variable is essentially a reserved memory location to store values. Think of it as a labeled box where you can put data, 
 and you use the label to refer to that data later in your program
 ### Rules for Naming Variables in Python (List Form)

1. Must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or an underscore `_`.
2. Cannot start with a number.
3. Can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
4. Spaces are not allowed.
5. Variable names are case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different).
6. Cannot use Python reserved keywords (e.g., `for`, `class`, `if`).
7. Special characters like `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `-` are not allowed.
8. Should not use Python built-in function names (e.g., `list`, `sum`, `dict`) – recommended.
9. Use meaningful and descriptive names – recommended.
10. Use `snake_case` naming style – recommended.

If you want this in **one-line exam-ready format**, tell me.

print(message)

'''here variable message stores string Hello from Python'''


age = 24
